The Problem we wish to solve is developing a routing algorithm which will route the bots of a specific color to its specific destination by color. 
Their routing must be performed smoothly without producing any obstruction to each other. 

### Working of the code

### Customization 

The 'generate' Function can be used to place walls and wherever the user wishes to do so. 

The icons A, B, C and D depict the positions of the bots at each state, and W, X, Y and Z depict the respective goals for each bot. 

GoalDict can also be changed to change the bot positions and goal Positions
